# Mozilla Add-On for low german spell check

This add-on adds low german (nds) spell check to Mozilla Firefox.

It uses LibreOffice's hunspell dictionary for low german,
which you can find [at this repository](https://github.com/tdf/dict_nds).

**Important** to this stage this repository is still experimental.
